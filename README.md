# Exploring Temporal

## What is a Workflow?

Conceptually, a workflow defines a sequence of steps. With Temporal, those steps are defined by writing code, known as a _**Workflow Definition**_, and are carried out by running that code, which results in a **_Workflow Execution_**.

<br>
<br>

## Temporal Architecture Overview

### Temporal Server

<br>

### Communication between Temporal Cluster and Temporal Application

![communications](/images/communication-v2.png)

Clients communicate with the Temporal Server by issuing requests to this Frontend Service. The Frontend Service then communicates with backend services, as necessary to fulfill the request, and then returns a response to the client. Communication to and within the Cluster is done using gRPC, a popular high-performance open source RPC framework originally developed at Google and now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem. The messages themselves are encoded using Protocol Buffers, an open source serialization mechanism also originally developed at Google.

### Temporal Cluster

<br>

### Workers

One thing that people new to Temporal may find surprising is that the Temporal Cluster does not execute your code. While the platform guarantees the durable execution of your code, it achieves this through orchestration. The execution of your application code is external to the cluster, and in typical deployments, takes place on a separate set of servers, potentially running in a different data center than the Temporal Cluster.

The entity responsible for executing your code is known as a Worker, and it's common to run Workers on multiple servers, since this increases both the scalability and availability of your application. The Worker, which is part of your application, communicates with the Temporal Cluster to manage the execution of your Workflows.

Since the Worker uses a Temporal Client to communicate with the Temporal Cluster, each machine running a Worker will require connectivity to the Clusterâ€™s Frontend Service, which listens on TCP port 7233 by default.

## Writing a Workflow Definition

A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the Workflow. Depending on the programming language, it's typically implemented as a function or an object method and encompasses the end-to-end series of steps of a Temporal application. There are two steps for turning a Java interface and implementation into a **_Workflow Definition_**:

1. Import the `io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowInterface` and `io.temporal.workflow.WorkflowMethod` annotation types provided by the SDK
2. Annotate the interface with `@WorkflowInterface`
3. Annotate the method signature with `@WorkflowMethod`

<br>

## Initializing Worker

### Role of a Worker

- Workers execute your Workflow code. 
- The Worker itself is provided by the Temporal SDK, but your application will include code to configure and run it. 
- When that code executes, the Worker establishes a persistent connection to the Temporal Cluster and begins polling a Task Queue on the Cluster, seeking work to perform.

### Initializing a Worker

There are typically three things you need in order to configure a Worker:

1. A **Temporal Client**, which is used to communicate with the Temporal Cluster
2. The name of a **Task Queue**, which is maintained by the Temporal Server and polled by the Worker
3. The name of the **Workflow Definition interface**, used to register the Workflow implementation with the Worker

```java
public class GreetingWorker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Represents the GRPC connection to the Temporal Cluster.
        // For Temporal Cluster is running on the same machine, we'll use newLocalServiceStubs(). 
        // When Temporal Cluster is on a dedicated server, we'll use newServiceStubs(WorkflowServiceStubsOptions options)
        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        
        // Create a Temporal Client using WorkflowServiceStubs
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
        
        // Creates one or more Worker instances
        WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);

        // Specify the name of the Task Queue that this Worker should poll
        Worker worker = factory.newWorker("greeting-tasks");

        // Specify which Workflow implementations this Worker will support
        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingImpl.class);

        // Begin running the Worker
        factory.start();
    }
}
```

### Lifetime of a Worker

The lifetime of the Worker and the duration of a Workflow Execution are unrelated. The start function used to start this Worker is a blocking function that doesn't stop unless it is terminated or encounters a fatal error. The Worker's process may last for days, weeks, or longer. If the Workflows it handles are relatively short, then a single Worker might execute thousands or even millions of them during its lifetime. On the other hand, a Workflow can run for years, while the server where a Worker process is running might be rebooted after a few months by an administrator doing maintenance. If the Workflow Type was registered with other workers, one or more of them will automatically continue where the original Worker left off. If there are no other Workers available, then the Workflow Execution will continue where it left off as soon as the original Worker is restarted. In either case, the downtime will not cause the Workflow Execution to fail.

<br>

## Code to start a Workflow

```java
public class Starter {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
        
        WorkflowOptions options = WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
                    .setWorkflowId("my-first-workflow")
                    .setTaskQueue("greeting-tasks")
                    .build();
       
        // Creating a new Workflow instance
        HelloWorkflowWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(HelloWorkflowWorkflow.class, options);
        
        // Blocking call on the Workflow
        String greeting = workflow.greetSomeone(args[0]);
        
        // Retrieving information of the workflow when execution is complete
        String workflowId = WorkflowStub.fromTyped(workflow).getExecution().getWorkflowId();

        System.out.println(workflowId + " " + greeting);

    }
}
```

> NOTE:
> 1. The code used to create and configure the `client` here is identical to the code used during Worker initialization. You can structure your application such that the same client is shared between those two parts of the code. In fact, this is common for real-world Temporal applications.
> 2. Workflow code must be **_deterministic_**, and must produce the same output each time, given the same input.

## What are activities ?

- Activities encapsulate business logic that is prone to failure. Unlike the Workflow Definition, there is no requirement for an Activity Definition to be deterministic.
- While Activities are executed as part of Workflow Execution, they have an important characteristic: they're retried if they fail.
- The code within that Activity Definition will be executed, retried if necessary, and the Workflow will continue its progress once the Activity completes successfully.

### Activity Definition

- The interface must be annotated with `@ActivityInterface`.
- Optionally, you can annotate your methods with `@ActivityMethod`, although this is not required unless you are attempting to specify optional arguments to the Activity.

```java
@ActivityInterface
public interface GreetingActivities {

    public String greetInSpanish(String name);
}
```

### Registering Activities

You may recall that you must register your Workflows when initializing the Worker. You must also perform a similar step for Activities. The process for registering the Activity is slightly different to that for registering a Workflow, with the only difference being the name of the function you call to register it, and by passing in an instance of the Activity implementation to the registration method.

```java
public class GreetingWorker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        WorkflowServiceStubs service = WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs();
        WorkflowClient client = WorkflowClient.newInstance(service);
        WorkerFactory factory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(client);
        Worker worker = factory.newWorker("greeting-tasks");
        worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(GreetingWorkflowImpl.class);

        // Registering an activity
        worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new GreetingActivitiesImpl());

        factory.start();
    }
}
```

### Specifying Activity Options 
The first step to executing an Activity as part of your Workflow is to specify the options that govern its execution. The following code would be written in the implementation of the Workflow Definition.

```java
    ActivityOptions options = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
        .build();
```

### Executing Activities

- Temporal Activities can be executed either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on your use case.
- To request execution of an Activity within your Workflow Definition, first call the `workflow.newActivityStub()` method, passing in the class object for your Activity Definition interface and the options (such as the Timeout described above) used to control its execution. This returns a client stub corresponding to your Activity Definition:

```java
    private final GreetingActivities activities = 
    Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class, options);
```

#### Executing Activity Synchronously
To execute the Activity synchronously you will call the method from the Workflow Definition and store the result in a variable. Each of these calls are blocking, meaning that the Workflow Execution will wait for the first method, `greetInSpanish`, to complete before attempting to execute `farewellInSpanish`.

```java
    String spanishGreeting = activities.greetInSpanish(name);
    String spanishFarewell = activities.farewellInSpanish(name);
```

Putting it all together:

```java
public class GreetingWorkflowImpl implements GreetingWorkflow {

    ActivityOptions options = ActivityOptions.newBuilder()
        .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
        .build();

    private final GreetingActivities activities = 
            Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class, options);

    @Override
    public String greetSomeone(String name){
        String spanishGreeting = activities.greetInSpanish(name);
        String spanishFarewell = activities.farewellInSpanish(name);

        return "\n" + spanishGreeting + "\n" + spanishFarewell;
    }
}
```


#### Executing Activity Asynchronously

- To execute the Activity asynchronously you will use Temporal's `Async` and `Promise` implementations.
- We pass in the Activity Method from the stubbed instance of our implementation and the variable name to Async.function. This will begin execution of the Activity and not wait for the Activity to complete before continuing execution. Because of this you will need to retrieve the result of the execution at a later point.

```java
...

private final GreetingActivities activities = 
    Workflow.newActivityStub(GreetingActivities.class, options);

...

Promise<String> hello = Async.function(activities::greetInSpanish, name);
Promise<String> bye = Async.function(activities::farewellInSpanish, name);
```

- The Workflow does not execute the Activity. That is, it does not invoke the Activity Function. Instead, it makes a request to the Temporal Cluster, asking it to schedule execution of the Activity.
- With asynchronous Activity Execution, you write separate statements to perform each operation. The call to Async.function returns a Promise, since the result returned by the Activity won't be available until the Activity has completed.
- To access the value from this Promise, you must first define a variable of the type corresponding to the value. Next, you will call the get function on the variable used to store the Promise. Be sure to check for an error before attempting to use the result, as this variable will not be assigned the value if the Activity Execution failed.

```java
String greeting;

try {
    greeting = hello.get();
} catch(RuntimeExeption e) {
    // handle the failure as dictated by your business logic
}
```

<br/>

## Workflow Deterministic Constraints

- A critical aspect of developing Workflow Definitions is ensuring they exhibit certain deterministic traits â€“ that is, making sure that the **_same Commands are emitted in the same sequence_**, whenever a corresponding **Workflow Function** Execution (instance of the Function Definition) is re-executed.
- The execution semantics of a Workflow Execution include the re-execution of a Workflow Function, which is called a **Replay**.
- The use of Workflow APIs in the function is what generates **Commands**. Commands tell the Cluster which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's **Event History**.
- When a Workflow Function executes, the Commands that are emitted are compared with the existing Event History. If a corresponding Event already exists within the Event History that maps to the generation of that Command in the same sequence, and some specific metadata of that Command matches with some specific metadata of the Event, then the Function Execution progresses.

### Reasons when workflow can be non-deterministic

If a generated Command doesn't match what it needs to in the existing Event History, then the Workflow Execution returns a non-deterministic error. The following are the two reasons why a Command might be generated out of sequence or the wrong Command might be generated altogether:
1. Code changes are made to a Workflow Definition that is in use by a running Workflow Execution.
2. There is intrinsic non-deterministic logic (such as inline random branching).

#### 1. Code changes

The Workflow Definition can change in very limited ways once there is a Workflow Execution depending on it. To alleviate non-deterministic issues that arise from code changes, recommendation is to use Workflow Versioning.

#### 2. Instrinsic non-deterministic logic

Intrinsic non-determinism is when a Workflow Function Execution might emit a different sequence of Commands on re-execution, regardless of whether all the input parameters are the same.

For example, a Workflow Definition can not have inline logic that branches (emits a different Command sequence) based off a local time setting or a random number, or data from unreliable resources. When those APIs are used, the results are stored as part of the Event History, which means that a re-executed Workflow Function will issue the same sequence of Commands, even if there is branching involved.

<br/>

## Versioning workflow code

- The Temporal Platform requires that Workflow code (Workflow Definitions) be deterministic in nature. This requirement means that developers should consider how they plan to handle changes to Workflow code over time.

- A versioning strategy is even more important if your Workflow Executions live long enough that a Worker must be able to execute multiple versions of the same Workflow Type.

- Apart from the ability to create new Task Queues for Workflow Types with the same name, the Temporal Platform provides Workflow Patching APIs and Worker Build Idâ€“based versioning features.
  
- **Patching APIs** enable the creation of logical branching inside a Workflow Definition based on a developer-specified version identifier. This feature is useful for Workflow Definition logic that needs to be updated but still has running Workflow Executions that depend on it.

     [How to patch Workflow code](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/java/versioning#patching)

- Temporal **Worker Build Id-based versioning** lets you define sets of versions that are compatible with each other, and then assign a Build Id to the code that defines a Worker.

## Handling Unreliable Worker processes

**_Do not handle Worker Process failure or restarts in a Workflow Definition._**

- Workflow Function Executions are completely oblivious to the Worker Process in terms of failures or downtime.
- The Temporal Platform ensures that the state of a Workflow Execution is recovered and progress resumes if there is an outage of either Worker Processes or the Temporal Cluster itself.
- The only reason a Workflow Execution might fail is due to the code throwing an error or exception, not because of underlying infrastructure outages.

<br/>

## Workflow Type

A Workflow Type is a name that maps to a Workflow Definition.

- A single Workflow Type can be instantiated as multiple Workflow Executions.
- A Workflow Type is scoped by a Task Queue. It is acceptable to have the same Workflow Type name map to different Workflow Definitions if they are using completely different Workers.
